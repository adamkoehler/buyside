            <h4 class="bold">3. Overview: How We Protect your Privacy</h4>
            
            <p>Buyside is an information service that combines data you provide with data from third parties and publically-available data. We can then report information back to you that helps you rent and sell properties.</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>All non-confidential information entered at Buyside is used by Buyside and its affiliates for the purpose of facilitating Buyside’s Site and Products, including the buyer management and listing process.</li>
            	<li>Email messages may be reviewed by our editorial team for compliance and security.
</li>
            	<li>All Buyer contact information is confidential and is never shared by us on the public site or to any subscribers of Buyside, rather it is only accessible by the agent listing that specific Buyer (“Buyer Agent”), the Buyer Agent’s business associates, and anyone with whom the Buyer Agent chooses to share the Buyer contact information.</li>
            	<li>Credit card information is never stored by Buyside. After a transaction is processed by Buyside, all credit card information is deleted from Buyside’s servers. Credit card information will be stored by credit card processing companies, banks and other financial institutions.</li>
            	<li>Buyside uses 128-bit data encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to better protect online transactions.</li>
            	<li>Buyside data is protected by and complies with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security requirements of Visa, MasterCard, American Express &amp; Discover, although we do not store credit card information.</li>
            	<li>We don’t share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, but we do share Non-Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
            	<li>Account information is password-protected. Please keep your password safe.</li>
            	<li>Forums use basic web server authentication. Please close your browser to log out.</li>
            	<li>Buyside subscribers may provide links to third-party websites through emails, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third-party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="bold">4. Data We Collect</h4>
            
            <p>During registration, we collect account information including username and password and contact information such as name, email and telephone number. Each of these different types of information is used to provide the BuysideSite and Products. Registration information is used to authenticate users, and contact information is used both for service-related communication and as an integral component of the application. In some cases, contact information will be sent to third party syndication partners who have the ability to anonymize email addresses.</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>We sometimes collect your email address for purposes such as sending self-publishing and confirmation emails, authenticating user accounts, providing subscription email services, registering for forums, and other communications.</li>
                <li>We sometimes collect your phone number for account authentication purposes, and may transmit it to a third party service for tele-robotic verification.</li>
                <li>Buyside does not store credit card information. Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and we endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</li>
                <li>We may collect Personal Information if you provide it in feedback or comments, or if you contact us directly. Please do not post any Personal Information in any correspondences or emails that you expect to keep private.</li>
                <li>Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, including your IP address, page URL, and timestamp. Web logs help us to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the BuysideSite, and to otherwise provide our service to you.</li>
                <li>We allow third-party companies to collect certain Non-Personal Information and other anonymous information when you visit our Site. These companies may use Non-Personal Information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</li>
            </ul>
           	<h4 class="bold">5. Data We Store</h4>         
            
            <p>We store all buyer listings in our database. Even after “deletion” from our database, we continue to store buyer listings, and they may be archived elsewhere.Our web logs and other records are stored indefinitely.<br><br>
Active Members can access and update their account information through the account homepage.<br><br>
All user information contained within the application will remain your property. We will continue to make that data available to you as long as you are a Member, and make that data available to you upon the termination of your relationship with Buyside.<br><br>
If at some point Buyside sells all or a portion of its assets or merges with another entity, user information is an asset that may be transferred or acquired by a third party. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify all affected users of any such transaction, and users will have the opportunity to retrieve their user information and cease usage of the Site and Products. After such a transaction, the third party that becomes the custodian of the user information would have the right to continue using the Personal Information solely as set forth in this Privacy Policy or any policy that may replace it where the new policy is instituted in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<h4 class="bold">6. Spam</h4>
            <p>We and our Members do not tolerate spam. Please set your communication preferences so we communicate with you as you prefer. To report spam or spoof emails to Buyside, please forward the email to Spam@GetBuyside.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools.</p>
            
            <h4 class="bold">7. Share This</h4>
            <p>When you use the “Share This” link to bookmark and share our Products and Site, you will be taken to a third party site. Please note that the third party sites’ privacy policies (and not this Privacy Policy) govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites.</p>
            
            <h4 class="bold">8. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</h4>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes that we make to this Privacy Policy will be effective thirty days after the sooner of providing a copy of the revised Privacy Policy or posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy. The date shown above indicates the date that we last revised this Privacy Policy. BY CONTINUING TO ACCESS OR USE THE BUYSIDE SITE OR PRODUCTS AFTER SUCH DATE, YOU WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE REVISED VERSION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If you cease using Buyside before the effective date of a particular revised version of this Privacy Policy, then you remain subject to the terms of the most recent version of this Privacy Policy in effect while you were using the Products. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may provide a more prominent notice of our choosing. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we are collecting, using, sharing and otherwise handling your Personal Information.</p>
            
            <h4 class="bold">9. Your Opt-Out Rights</h4>
            <p>As an Organization, Administrator, or Member, you have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications (whether through mail, telephone or email) from us or any of our affiliates or vendors regarding other products, services and promotions available from us.

            <h4 class="bold">10. Security of Your Personal Information.</h4>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us.

            <h4 class="bold">14. Disclosure.</h4>            
            <p>We may disclose aggregated Non-Personal Information that has been collected from you and others to our existing or potential vendors or other third parties, or in response to a government request or demand. We may also share Non-Personal Information, including aggregated and de-identified demographic data,with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and discounts on our Products.</p>
            
            <h4 class="bold">15. Third Party Websites &amp; Links.</h4>
            <p>We cannot control, and are not responsible for, any third party’s use of cookies, web beacons or other tracking technology that collect information about you or others.
